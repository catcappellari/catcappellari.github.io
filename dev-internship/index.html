				<h3>What do you hope to achieve through this internship?</h3>
				<p>I would like to gain experience working in an agency setting, build my connections, grow my design and development skills, and walk my first steps in my career as web developer. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="half">
				<div class="number"><h2>2.</h2></div>
				<h3>Are there particular skills or technologies you'd like to learn or work with?</h3>
				<p> I am very interesting in becoming much better-versed at working with WordPress because it is such a versatile content management system. I'm very interested in working on my JavaScript/JQuery skills and adding Bootstrap to my repertoire. I would love to really master writing efficient code. I make an effort to code each new project better than the one before.</p>

				<div class="number"><h2>3.</h2></div>
				<h3>This internship will be a hybrid of 20% in-person and 80% remote, do you think you'll work well without regular support and oversight?</h3>
				<p>I am a self-starter and love to learn. I do the same work whether I am being observed or not; however, I do save wearing my Grandma slippers for my at-home endeavors. I've been hard at work designing and building on my own ever since my course ended in November. It is always nice to have coworkers around, but when they aren't I am very resourceful. If I get truly stuck on something, I know how to find things that I do know how to do in the meantime.

			<div class="whole">
				<div class="number"><h2>4.</h2></div>
				<h3>Explain how design and development intersect. What role do you see a developer playing in the design process?</h3>
				<p>I think it's very important that designers and developers talk to one another during the design process. I have come up with really nifty designs that were nearly impossible to actually code when I got to the markup stage. My teacher let me find this out the hard way, which was tough at the time but taught me a valuable lesson about planning that I remember each time I work on a design now. Designs should take development feasibility into account, and development should respect the design process and abide by the mockup. 
				</p>

			<div class="whole">
				<div class="number"><h2>5.</h2></div>
				<h3>Describe how grids are useful, and how you generally go about using them, or implementing them.</h3>
				<p>Grids are useful for keeping elements organized and tidy on the page. I start using grids in the design phase. I have a loose grid in place for thumbnails and a measured one for mockups in Photoshop. How many columns and how much gutter I use depends what screen size and what kind of information I'm working with. In the markup phase, I tend to prefer using floats over inline-block to implement grids because I find them a little easier to work with and they hold up on older, less pleasant browsers.

			<div class="half">
				<div class="number"><h2>6a.</h2></div>
				<h3>Talk a little bit about pattern libraries. What are they and how are they useful? Have you used them before?</h3>
				<p>A pattern library is a system that developers put into place to give a website a unified feel. Everyone working on the site follows the same guidelines so that things like the navigation and buttons look the same across all pages. It also prevents extra work, since designing appropriate buttons once instead of five times saves time and money. This probably also helps in future redesign projects. I have not had the chance to use a pattern library yet, but it sounds efficient so I'm already a fan.

			<div class="half">
				<div class="number"><h2>6b.</h2></div>
				<h3>Talk a little bit about visual systems. What are they and how are they useful? Have you used them before?</h3>
				<p>A visual system ensures that the site you are designing 'feels' like the same site regardless of whether you are visiting it on your phone, tablet, or computer. Colors, fonts, basic setups, and the like should remain the same. I try to implement a visual system for any website I build. For example, the structure of a navigation bar may be narrower and more stacked on smaller screen sizes, but it remains the same color and the menu options look basically the same regardless of screen size.

				<h3>Describe your experience developing for Wordpress. Go into detail, please.</h3>
				<p>I am pretty new to WordPress. So far I have: 
					<ol>
						<li><p>Set up MAMP on my computer</p></li>
   						<li><p>Found a theme on WordPress.org that I thought might be useful as a foundation</p></li>
   						<li><p>Begun to tinker with said theme, changing the navigation position to fixed in header.php and changing the background</p></li>
   						<li><p>Installed a subtitle plugin</p></li>
   					</ol>

			<div class="third">
				<div class="number"><h2>8.</h2></div>
				<h3>Is this your first time using version control? If not, tell us about other times you've used it, and which technologies.
				</h3>
				<p>I have been using GitHub for awhile now. So far it is the only version control that I have used. I am a little familiar with Waffle.io, which helps organize GitHub tasks.

				</p>

			<div class="third">
				<div class="number"><h2>9.</h2></div>
				<h3>Do you have experience with CSS pre-processors? Which one do you prefer and why?</h3>
				<p>I have used SCSS for the past few months here. I appreciate that it helps me keep my CSS organized. I especially love how easy it is to create mixins to simplify styling tasks.

				<div class="number"><h2>10.</h2></div>
				<h3>What is your comfort level with responsive design? Have you done any mobile-first projects before? Tell us about what you know.</h3>
				<p>My Iron Yard instructor was adamant about designing for mobile first. I went rogue on one project and coded for tablet first. Predictably, it was a nightmare to fix and I'll never do it again. Teacher: amused. Cat: sheepish.</p> 
				<p>In that experience, I found that it is much more difficult to fix media queries backwards than to just build them up from smaller screen sizes initially. You can't 'just ignore' mobile either: It is wildly important to create a mobile-friendly site since so much traffic is now on mobile instead of desktop. <a href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2015/05/building-for-next-moment.html">Google found</a> that in 2015, mobile searches surpassed desktop searches in several countries including the US. It would be terrible to provide a sub-par experience or, possibly worse, to delete content to make it 'fit' onto mobile, for so many users. People expect to have full functionality and full information regardless of what they're using to access your site. 
				</p>
				<p>In practice, sometimes I change images resolutions and/or measurement ratios based on screen size. In mobile everything becomes more stacked, and the navigation bar does change so that buttons are easier to click on. It is a nice touch to add a click-to-call links for mobile users as well.</p>

				<h3>What books or blogs do you like to read, people you follow on twitter, etc. to keep up with the latest trends in front-end development?
				</h3>
				<p>I enjoy <a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> for general web design/development information.</p> 

				<p>For design inspiration, I like to visit <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a> and <a href="http://fontpair.co/">FontPair.co</a>. Sometimes I just wander around on Google as well. I am also reading through <a href="http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/">Thinking with Type</a> to learn more about typography.</p>

				<p>For coding questions, I often go to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. I think <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/">CSS-Tricks</a> is wonderful and presents complex issues in a very helpful way. I am on page 30 (of 622) of <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118531647.html">JavaScript & JQuery Interactive Front-End Web Development</a> and so far it has been helpful. 
				</p>

			<div class="half">
				<div class="number"><h2>12.</h2></div>
				<h3>What tools, frameworks, etc. do you enjoy using? Tell us why.
				</h3>
				<p>I like using SublimeText as my text editor and iTerm as my terminal. Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop are nice for wireframing and mockups. To be honest, familiarity is the reason that they are the ones that I use! I do love the simplicity of my $3 sketchbook and my trusty Uniball pen for thumbnails. <a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/">ColorZilla</a> is great for creating gradients for buttons and things. I am always eager to learn about more great tools.

			<div class="half">
				<div class="number"><h2>13.</h2></div>
				<h3>Explain how HTML, CSS, and JS interact - what is each layer responsible for?
				</h3>
				<p>HTML provides the backbone and basic information on the site. If you're watching a house being built, it would be the scaffolding. CSS provides the nice visuals and layout of the site. In the HTML house, it would be things like the paint color and walls. JavaScript is all about action. It can do fun things like slide elements over or move them down. In the HTML house, JavaScript might be something like the dimmer switch on a light. It adds an extra layer of cool, but if it breaks you should ideally still have a light. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="whole">
				<div class="number"><h2>14.</h2></div>
				<h3>Progressive enhancement or graceful degradation? Choose your side.
				</h3>
				<p>I like the idea of progressive enhancement because, like mobile-first design, it begins from the bottom up. You might as well start simple and build upon that. Just because someone isn't browsing with JavaScript enabled doesn't mean that the internet shouldn't work for them. And trying to build back towards older browsers after writing fancy code seems inefficient.
