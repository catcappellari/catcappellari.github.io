						<h2>Discovery</h2>
						<p>One Columbia for Arts & History is a non-profit organization formed to support and promote tourism in Columbia, South Carolina. Their mission is to advise, amplify and advocate for the unified arts and history community. They currently use a paper passport system so their patrons can track events that they have attended.</p> 

						<p>One Columbia is seeking a visual prototype for a digital  Passport in the form of a native iPhone app that uses AR Codes and geo-tagging to allow users to check into culture events.The goal of the digital Passport is to supplement, and eventually replace, their existing printed passports since the cost of printing and distributing hard materials is prohibitive. They have the additional goal of augmenting the app with features that only a mobile device can provide.</p> 

						<p>This app created for anyone in the greater Columbia area who wishes to engage in local arts and who has access to an iPhone.</p>
						

						<h2>Scope</h2>
						<p>The scope of this project includes wireframes, thumbnails, mockups, and an interactive prototype in InVision.</p>

						<p>The actions included in this app are a login area, an AR check-in area, a notes/stamp collection section, and an upcoming-events details section.</p>
