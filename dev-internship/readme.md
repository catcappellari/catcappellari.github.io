# Instructions

Hi there! I'm glad you're interested in our developer internship here at New Kind. It wasn't *that* long ago that I was in your shoes, eager to break into the web-world.

It's my goal for our intern to learn a ton of practical, real-world skills and knowledge, so that you're ready to step right into a developer role either here at New Kind, or wherever it is you'd like to go in the world.

Let's start learning now! I'm going to need you to go fork this repo on github to submit your response. Don't know how to do that yet? That's ok! This industry is full of learning every day, and your ability and willingness to pick up new skills is paramount in what we're looking for. Get your hands dirty! [Here's a good place to start](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
