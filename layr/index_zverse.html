		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		
		<h2>Discovery</h2>

		<h3>What is zVerse?</h3>
		<h4>zVerse is an applications company focused on accelerating the creation of meaningful 3D printable content. With the LAYR 3D Content Creation Platform, zVerse is creating a suite of software applications that makes any 2D content 3D printable. Since being founded in 2012, zVerse's technology has brought meaningful, high-quality 3D printed content to brands and organizations all over the world.</h4>

		<h3></h3>
		<h4>As part of their "turnkey" 3D printing service, zVerse is having to manage a growing 3D artist network. Until now, zVerse has managed artist interations on a case-by-case basis. However, one-on-one management isn't scalable with new business opportunities.</h4>
		<h4>zVerse is building a platform called LAYR that will allow them to automate, and therefore scale, the processes of new artist evaluation, job allocation, asset management, and artist invoicing.</h4>

		<h3>Who is the target audience for the site? What information/content is the audience looking for?</h3>
		<h4>The LAYR Platform will assist all artists in finding projects and payments.</h4>
