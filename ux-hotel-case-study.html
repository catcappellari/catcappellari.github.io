          <p>This project was done through a course offered by <a href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="u-text-deco">UX Design Institute.</a> The goal of this project was
            to create a mobile
            booking app for a new hotel company that was hoping for a simple and accessible process that would allow
            users to quickly find and reserve hotel rooms. The competitive landscape includes giant companies like
            Hotels.com as well as brand-specific sites and apps like Best Western and Wyndham. Vacation rentals like
            AirBnb are also part of the picture. The large group of competitors meant that usability and convenience
            were key. This lead us to the research phase of the project.</p>

        <div class="u-mt-2">
          <p>The research phase included a competitive benchmark as well as user testing. We began with competitive
            benchmarking to get an overall feel for the environment, then moved on the user testing to see how others
            fared with competitor sites. These findings revealed that even in a crowded market, there was room for a
            new app to provide a better experience than that found with many established brands. Some of the existing
            hotel app solutions had gotten a bit bogged-down with calls to action and lengthy forms, while others were
            difficult to operate.</p>

        <hr class="u-bg-alt3 hr-tall">
        <div class="u-mt-2">
          <p>The analysis phase of the design process deals with organizing and synthesizing information gathered in the
            research phase. Patterns begin to emerge at this stage, and lessons learned must be grouped so that they
            can be used in the design phase. We began with creating an affinity diagram with insights from the
            competitive benchmark and the user testing. The affinity diagram helped us zoom in on issues and group
            them in meaningful ways. After that, we completed a customer journey map of the users' whole decision
            process. This provided a bird's-eye view of the task.</p>

              diagram</a> stage synthesized the findings from the research stage. On my first attempt at an affinity
            diagram, I found myself creating groups based on location in the process on the app. After re-working my
            diagram, new patterns emerged. Several things, like iconography and good copy, were items that were themes
            throughout the experience and not just local to one part of the process. Seeing this as its own group on
            the board highlighted how important it was. Key groups included: </p>
          <ul class="u-list">
            <li>Reasons for choosing a brand</li>
            <li>UI elements (the date selector, iconography, etc)</li>

            identify where the product fits within the user's larger decision-making process as
            well as to identify various emotions through the hotel booking experience. The journey map was helpful in
            solidifying where parts of the online booking experience went right and where parts of it went wrong. The
            customer journey map helped really drive home the importance of making sure the search was as good an
            experience as possible since the user tests had showed that it was a point of frustration. Top insights
            included: </p>
          <ul class="u-list">

        <p>The prototyping stage included a medium-fidelity

          provide a close representation of the final product or testing while still having a fairly quick
          completion
          time. While setting up the prototype, I ended up adding the map to the top of the results page and making
          the filters a modal. I realized that a large frustration in the search process was not having a good idea
          of
          where each hotel was located, so hopefully a map being visible first thing would be helpful. </p>

          <p>This project identified some key areas where a new hotel could outshine existing hotel apps, including in

            remove our own biases or expectations from the picture by allowing the feedback of users to guide the design
            of the new app.</p>
