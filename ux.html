          <h3 class="u-color-alt3">Goals</h3>
          <p>The goal was to <b class="u-color-alt3">create a mobile
              booking app</b> for a new hotel company that was hoping for <b class="u-color-alt3">a simple and
              accessible process</b> that would allow
            users to quickly find and reserve hotel rooms</b>. The competitive landscape includes giant companies like
            Hotels.com as well as brand-specific sites and apps like Best Western and Wyndham. The large group of
            competitors meant that <b class="u-color-alt3">usability and convenience
              were key</b>.
          <h3 class="u-color-alt3">Scope</h3>
          <p>This project was done through a course offered by <a href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="u-text-deco">UX Design Institute.</a> It lasted for six
            months and covered the full design process from research to wireframes.</p>

        <div class="u-mt-2">
          <p>The research phase included a competitive benchmark as well as user testing. I began with competitive
            benchmarking to get an overall feel for the environment, then moved on to user testing to see how users
            fared with competitor sites. These findings revealed that <b class="u-color-alt3">even in a crowded market,
              there was room for a
              new app to provide a better experience than that found with many established brands</b>. Some of the
            existing
            hotel app solutions had gotten a bit bogged-down with calls to action and lengthy forms, while others were
            difficult to operate.</p>

          <p class="u-mb-1">The competitive benchmarking process was helpful in getting to know the current

            findings: </p>
          <ul class="u-list">
            <li>Uncluttered interfaces were helpful</li>
            <li>Minimizing form length was a positive</li>

        <div class="u-mb-2">
          <p>Insights were collected from three different usability tests. Two of the tests were part of the course
            materials, while the third was conducted live. The tester demographics were as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Participant 1: male, Irish, father of small children, 35 - 45</li>
            <li>Participant 2: male, Irish, in a long-term relationship, 25 - 35</li>
            <li>Participant 3: male, American, in a long-term relationship, 25 - 35</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This pool was fairly small and did not cover a particularly broad demographic range. <b
              class="u-color-alt3">It would have been
              helpful to conduct tests with a few more people to ensure adequate coverage</b>. Hotel apps are used by a
            large
            and diverse audience, after all.</p>
          <p>Despite the small test group, usability testing still allowed us to get to know the target user
            base and discover which parts of the process were positive and which sparked frustration. The <a

        <div class="u-mt-2">
          <p>The analysis phase of the design process deals with organizing and synthesizing information gathered in the
            research phase. Patterns begin to emerge at this stage, and lessons learned must be grouped so that they
            can be used in the design phase. I began with creating an affinity diagram with insights from the
            competitive benchmark and the user testing. <b class="u-color-alt3">The affinity diagram helped me zoom in
              on issues and group
              them in meaningful ways. After that, I completed a customer journey map of the users' whole decision
              process. This provided a bird's-eye view of the task.</b></p>

            diagram, I found myself creating groups based on location in the process on the app. <b
              class="u-color-alt3">After re-working my
              diagram, new patterns emerged. Several things, like iconography and good copy, were items that were themes
              throughout the experience and not just local to one part of the process.</b> Seeing this as its own group
            on

            solidifying <b class="u-color-alt3">which parts of the online booking experience went right and where parts

            The
            customer journey map helped really drive home the importance of making sure the search was as good an

              hotel apps, including in the search, calendar, and final booking stages.</b> By walking through the design
            process, I did my best
            to
            remove my own biases or expectations from the picture by allowing the feedback of users to guide the design
            of the new app.</p>
          <div class="u-my-2 u-p-2 u-bg-light">
            <p>"Nice prototype the CTA's were obvious. It was intuitive simple to use, well done. It's
              clear to see the solutions already defined in the flow diagram and interaction design
              have been depicted here."</p>

          <p><b>Observing other people using a product helps remove personal biases as well as highlight areas for
              improvement</b>. As someone who relies heavily on filters and maps, I was surprised to see that the
            testers did not quickly reach for either of these tools. I tried to make these tools easier to find on my
            app in case they just were not obvious enough on the tested apps.</p>
          <p>The <b>importance of following accessibility guidelines also came to the forefront when one user mentioned
              that he was struggling to read low-contrast text</b>. Sound bites like this one could be very helpful in
            making sure everyone is on board with following best practices.
          </p>
          <p><b>A survey would have added more helpful data and allowed for triangulation</b>. A user test of my working
            prototype would have provided data on whether the map and filters being more obvious actually helped users
            narrow down their searches faster. All in all, I really enjoyed working on this project and look forward to
            learning more as I complete more projects.</p>
